III. Eligibility & recruitment process (200 words max, required)

For this program, we will target students in the Chico area who are high school age (grades 9-12) as our primary audience. Our program will take place over three successive Saturdays (Sept. 14, 21, & 28), and recruitment will take place over the summer and in the opening weeks of school (the 2013-14 school year starts mid-August). The NCWP holds an annual Young Writers Festival each summer, and through that and other programs has established contacts with many local teachers and educational leaders. We will leverage that network to publicize the program. We will also publicize with out-of-school youth networks such as the Boys and Girls Club of Chico, the Chico Area Recreation District, and through press releases and PSAs. We will use social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, interest based websites, etc.) where local school-groups, parents, teachers, and students connect, learn, and collaborate.

As with our other programs for youth, we will require registration and a modest fee ($50 per student). We will offer scholarships and encourage interested students to apply regardless of ability to pay. Our purpose in requiring paid registration is not to generate funds, but to ensure participation. We have found that free programs actually encourage absenteeism because the participants (and/or their families) have no direct investment in the program.

III. Eligibility & recruitment process (200 words max, required)

For this program, we will target up to 30 students in the Chico area who are high school age (grades 9-12) as our primary audience. Our program will take place over three successive Saturdays (Sept. 14, 21, 28);recruitment will take place over the summer and in the opening weeks of the 2013-14 school (mid-August). The NCWP has established contacts with many local teachers and educational leaders through other youth programs. We will leverage that network to publicize the program. We will also publicize with out-of-school youth networks such as the Boys and Girls Club, the Chico Area Recreation District, and through press releases. We will use social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, interest based websites, etc.) where local school-groups, parents, teachers, and students connect, learn, and collaborate.

As with our other youth programs, we will require registration and a modest fee ($50 per student). We will offer scholarships and encourage interested students to apply regardless of ability to pay. Our purpose in requiring paid registration is not to generate funds, but to ensure participation. We have found that free programs encourage absenteeism because the participants (and/or their families) have no direct investment in the program.

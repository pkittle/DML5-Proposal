VI. Born Brave Bus Tour (300 words max, optional)

If awarded the opportunity for a visit from the Born Brave Bus Tour, we would take advantage of this resource to showcase work created by our youth-participants, reinforce connected-learning ideals of “open” and “fair,” model similar youth-created projects to inspire continued participation, honor youth connected-learning activities that promote kindness, safety, and bravery, and promote digital citizenship.   

Our proposed project includes a day for youth-participants to showcase their work to the local community.  The Born Brave Bus Tour would attract a larger audience of youth-participants, students, parents, and community members to the project's showcase.  This would add legitimacy to the project reinforcing the purpose and audience of the project.   Through modeling, it would encourage greater and continued participation in connected-learning and community building in the Chico area.   

Our proposed project asks youth-participants to share their work through publishing on the Bravest Map Ever!.  They will create online resources using Mozilla's Thimble and PopcornMaker that highlight why and how their chosen community resources help teens live "kindly, safely, and bravely." We will explore how sharing information "openly" can help improve access to "coolness" in the real world.

A visit could run in conjunction with the showcase on September 28th at the 1078 Gallery, a public arts and performance venue and/or when convenient at one of the project’s youth-participant identified “kind, safe, and brave” locales in the Chico community.

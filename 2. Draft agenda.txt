(*Title of Project*) will bring secondary students in the Chico community together to collaborate on a project that aggregates knowledge and information about locations to publish and promote user created and remixed content.  This project aims to build a bridge between physical locals and networked information.

Rather than simply linking to information, participants will be tasked with content creation and content remixing.  They will use simple web creation tools like Mozilla's Thimble to build webpages whose content will be user created.  

The purpose for the participant created content will be to inform about locations that are important culturally to young people.  The focus will be to identify locations where "making" takes place in the community.  Chico is a "maker" friendly town.  Our participants will be encouraged to focus efforts on locations where youth create.  

The audience for the work will be the local public.  We will publicize the participant created projects by attaching markers(QR codes) that will link physical locations with the web content.  The public will be able to access the participant created content using mobile technology by scanning the code.  A unique relationship will be created through this process where the public will be able to access and contribute to online content.  

## Notes 

- Participants will meet to make introductions and form teams based on interests
- Participants will go do inquiry based research  
	- *We will need a topic: I am thinking something like, "Where in our community are "maker spaces" for youth?" 
or "Where are the hangouts in our community?"*
- Participants will aggregate research and write 
- Participants will use Mozilla Thimble to create a webpage that to publish information regarding the location
- Participants will publish the location on the [Born Brave](http://bornthiswayfoundation.org/map) site
- Participants will create QR codes that attach to locations and link to the published work
	
=======
- We will decide how to publish and share findings

- We will build something (a map or something using QR codes)


- Our goals come out of the [Web Literacy Standards](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Learning/WebLiteracyStandard) developed by Mozilla.

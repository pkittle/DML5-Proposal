II. Draft Agenda (500 Words max.)

We propose a 3-day sequence of work for this project. The first two days will be Saturdays in September, held on the CSU, Chico campus, with a third Saturday that combines a working morning and lunch with an afternoon celebration when youth-participants will go public with their work for parents, friends, and community members. 

The project will be co-directed by NCWP Teacher-Consultants Lou Buran and Lynn Jacobs, experienced teachers who use exciting, engaging technology in their classrooms. Graduate students in the CSU, Chico English department who are enrolled in NCWP Director Peter Kittle’s Theories of Literacy seminar will serve the project as mentors, supporting participants’ small group inquiry projects.

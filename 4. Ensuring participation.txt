IV. Ensuring participation (100 words max, required)

Chico is a university town with a population that values rich educational experiences. As such, this program should be attractive to both students and parents. Transportation should be a non-issue: unlike large urban spaces, getting around Chico is straightforward, with simple and efficient public transport and myriad bike routes that facilitate youthful transit in the city.

Perhaps the idea of spending three Saturdays indoors during studentsâ€™ precious weekends might discourage some participation. We will emphasize that this program mixes web development with "Away From Keyboard" activities where participants will be conducting hands-on inquiry into the community in active, physical ways.

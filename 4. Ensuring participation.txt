> Briefly discuss factors that may limit participant turnout, and describe measures to be taken to ameliorate these constraints. For example, where local transportation may be difficult or expensive, measures could be taken to provide local transportation for participants by supplying city bus passes, etc.

Chico is a university town with a population that values rich educational experiences. As such, this program should be attractive to both students and parents. The NCWP is an organization of teachers, so getting the word out to the community will not be a problem. 

Perhaps the idea of spending a full day indoors during the beautiful Chico summer might discourage some participation.  We can emphasize that this program mixes web development with ["AFK"](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=afk) activities where participants are going to explore the community actively and physically.
